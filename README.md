Capturing Arm Motion: Control & Visualization of a Robotic Hand
Semi-graduate Project Â· 2025

Built a motion-capturing suit using ESP32 and IMUs to control a simulated 7-DOF robotic arm.

Visualized real-time motion in Blender; arm designed in SolidWorks.

Used Arduino IDE, MATLAB, and custom filtering for IMU data.
